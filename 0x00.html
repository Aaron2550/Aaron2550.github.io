        <h1>Creating x509 Certificates using Vanilla C#</h1>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p>For a while now, I've been attempting to create certificates that I can use with C#'s SslStream.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of the methods and libraries I've tried, such as <a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/">BouncyCastle</a>, have not worked for me at all.</p>
        <p>However, I recently discovered that it's actually quite simple in vanilla C# - you just need to know how to do it.</p>

        <p>Here's everything you need to know:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-csharp">using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

CertificateRequest Request = new(new X500DistinguishedName("cn=Whatever"), RSA.Create(8192), HashAlgorithmName.SHA512, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
X509Certificate2 Certificate = Request.CreateSelfSigned(DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1), DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(+1));
File.WriteAllBytes("Certificate.pfx", Certificate.Export(X509ContentType.Pfx));</code></pre>
        
        <p>If you'd like to add alternative Subject Names or Key Usages, you can use this example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-csharp">SubjectAlternativeNameBuilder AlternativeNameBuilder = new();
AlternativeNameBuilder.AddDnsName("localhost")
Request.CertificateExtensions.Add(new X509EnhancedKeyUsageExtension(new OidCollection {
  new("1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1") // Server Auth
}, false));

Request.CertificateExtensions.Add(new X509KeyUsageExtension(X509KeyUsageFlags.DigitalSignature, false));
Request.CertificateExtensions.Add(AlternativeNameBuilder.Build());</code></pre>

        <p>Compared to the approximately 20 lines of code required with BouncyCastle, this method is much easier.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you won't need to download 3-15 <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle.Cryptography">megabytes of libraries</a> to make it work.</p>
        <p>When I tried using BouncyCastle, I ran into issues where my certificate wasn't recognized and I received the error message <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Win32Exception: The credentials passed to the package were not recognized</code></pre>.</p>
        <p>However, I have not encountered this problem with the vanilla C# method outlined above.</p>
